# Angular Notes Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Using the Application

Most of the application should be intuitive, however there are some parts that are a bit rough around the edges due to this being my first Angular application and just wanting to test my knowledge primarily of the new features of Angular that I've learned.

### Adding a Note

Click the pencil icon in the top right and fill in the input box that appears to set the title of the new note. When the title is entered, press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> button to add the note to the list of notes in the application.

### Editing a Note's Content

Double click on the note area to enter 'editing mode'. The note can then be edited however you want. When you are done, use the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to exit 'editing mode'.

### Editing a Note's Title

Similarly to editing the note content, double clicking on the title will enter 'editing mode' for the title of that particular note. This can then be confirmed by using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key or the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

### Deleting a Note

When you hover over the an item in list of notes to the left, a trash can icon should appear for that particular note. Simply click on the red trash can and the note will be deleted.
